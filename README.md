# SALES TRACKER DEVELOPMENT


## ISSUE
As sales executive, our main role is to close new sales and follow up clients on recurring payments. We have to make sure the payments received are tally with transactions received by Finance department as well as company sales report. From what I discovered, many of us (Sales Team) didn't have proper system to track sales record which can lead to inaccuracy of data. For instance, few of them did record their sales manually on paper or own spreadsheet with no relevant functions that could automate their work.


## SOLUTION
I developed a "SALES TRACKER" template by using Google Sheets which is efficient for tracking sales record, and showing dashboard on individual performance. I also shared the template to team for their personal use as well as demonstrated them the maintenance of the template.
